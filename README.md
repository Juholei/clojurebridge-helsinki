# ClojureBridge - Helsinki

## Develop

```bash
lein develop
```

Open browser at ```http://localhost:3499/index.html```

Test production build:

```bash

This builds production version to project root (that's where gh-pages looks for it). Open

git add your-changes-here
git commit -m you-message-here
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
./build.sh
```

everything looks ok, then proceed with:

```basg
git add index.html js css img
git commit -m some-meaningfull-message
git push
git checkout master
```
